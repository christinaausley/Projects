# GOTO Meetup May 5, 2021

## Abstract
Camunda Platform BPMN is an industry-leading platform for deploying Business Brocess Automation across a wide variety of industries but it's not in wide spread use across the IoT community, and we want to see that change.

After all, the IoT is not just about collecting vast amounts of data, but it's also about taking targeted, business-critical *actions* based on that data. And if you want to take actions to further your business objectives, you should have clearly defined business processes to do that.

So I'm going to talk about an on-going project I'm working doing. I'm building some some IoT sensors and actuators to build a proof-of-concept for Greenhouse Automation. It's a part-hardware, part-software project. I'm building some sensors like temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure and some actuators like servos and stepper motors all connected wirelessly to monitor and control the greenhouse. I'm using Camunda Platform BPMN to orchestrate all the data and services and integrate the data from sensors both outside and inside the greenhouse with objectives for the greenhouse. I'll walk through the overall project, what the objectives are, and how I plan to meet them as well as dive into some microcontroller code, some BPMN code, and whatever else we can think of!
