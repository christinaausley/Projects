# A Proof of Concept for Camunda Platform with IoT

## Abstract
Looking to bring Camunda to the attention of the IoT Community by completing a larger IoT/Camunda Proof of Concept Project. This would entail an IoT Build, using Camunda Platform, documentation, a blog post, and promotion to the wider IoT Community.

## Why pursue this project
In many my initial discussions when joining the company, IoT was mentioned quite frequently as an important, but as-yet untapped market for Camunda Platform. In order to get Camunda 'noticed' in this market, which is vast, we need to start doing things that the community would possibly notice, and then track the engagements from those thing.

This can give us important insights into whether or not the IoT market is interested in using BPMN to orchestrate tasks based on IoT data as well as be an introduction of Camunda to the IoT community.

It hits on many important aspects of what we do including community/customer feedback, increasing awareness, and engagement.

## What does success look like?
Success, in this instance, doesn't mean just completing the project. Actually completing this project is not the hurdle. The real measure of success will be how much 'attention' and traction in the wider IoT community we can garner through this project.

Some of the metrics to collect and measure would be:

- Number of people who read the blog post(s) about this project
- How many of those readers do we 'convert' to click-through to the Camunda website?
- Number of tweets/retweets of the project and it's parts
- Questions asked about the project

The OKRs around metrics I plan to use are:
- 20,000 post-reads on the blog(s) posted about the project
- 1% conversion to Camunda.com click-through

## Project Idea

As mentioned, building automation is a potential target market for Camunda and IoT due to the high level of adoption, the requirement for complex orchestration, and the current push to move more systems into this area.

> In their early days, building management systems (BMS), also called building automation systems (BAS), proved to be a game-changer. The availability of a computer-based control system that could automatically monitor and manage a building’s largest and costliest operational components helped facilities managers do their jobs better. Building automation systems saved time and money, reduced energy waste, and gave facilities managers a way to better monitor their operations.
>
> Fast-forward to today, and you have another game-changer: the Internet of Things (IoT) for buildings. At their core, these technologies intersect in some important ways, but it’s where the IoT veers off from BMS that makes it more valuable to facilities personnel as a management tool. This article examines how an IoT analytics reporting platform can enhance the performance of the BMS by offering feedback on energy efficiency—and how that change might impact the role of facilities managers.<sup>[1]</sup>

In a previous DevRel position I did a small project about calculating some environmental data like Vapor Pressure Differential, etc. which ended up being *hugely* popular. Apparently these sorts of calculations and data are extremely important in greenhouse operations. Maintinaing proper temperature, humidity, etc. is key to the success of a greenhouse operation and the ability to automate and monitor these things are a key need in the industry.

Greenhouse management is a subset of the larger building automation market segment but one that is growing faster than the overall BMS market.

> According to Verified Market Research, The Global Smart Greenhouse Market was valued at USD 0.98 Billion in 2018 and is projected to reach USD 2.46 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 12.11% from 2018 to 2026.<sup>[2]</sup>

This makes this an attractive target for a PoC.
